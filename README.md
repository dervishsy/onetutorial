# OneTutorial - A practical journey into the Rust Programming Language

This little project will help you touch many topics around Rust, in a small and contained way. It will touch

* struct
* Vec
* enum
* HashMap
* Generics
* impl block
* traits
* Error handling
* Async
* JSON (de)serialization 
* reading .env variables
* Integrating CLI commands
* Reading/writing from/to a file
* Cross-compiling Rust code 
* Sending E-Mails via Rust
* Modularising your code 
* Testing* 
* Macros* 


## What you will build

You can adjust the tutorial to your needs, but I find it more usefull to create something you will actually use. Therefore: 

> Update and read from a Google Sheet where you store your latest financial information and send out an E-Mail with a summary. 

This can be adjuste to:

> Update and read from a **CSV file** where you store your latest financial information and send out an E-Mail with a summary.

If you are not interested in the topic (finance), feel free to adjust it to whatever data inputs you consume a lot and want to automise.
